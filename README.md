wp-obscurity
============

Settings to obscure your WordPress installation.


This plug-in allows you to set the following options:

 1. **Remove or hash the generator tag** - Doing so helps conceal which version of WP you're using
 2. **Remove version string from URLs** - same as above
 3. **Remove the X-Pingback header** - same as above
 4. **Remove extra meta tags in <head>** - same as above (this is enabled by themes)
 5. **Obscure login error messages** - Prevents telling the user whether they've entered a valid login
 

Also gives recommendations for:

 1. **Administrator username** - should not be "admin"
 2. **Database table prefix** - should not be "wp_"
 3. **Force SSL for admin/logins** - preferable
 4. **Disallow file editing in wp-admin** - preferable
